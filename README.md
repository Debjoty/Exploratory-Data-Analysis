# 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis | Python Project

Welcome to the **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** project – a data exploration and visualization notebook created using Python. This project dives deep into the dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and actionable insights.

---

## 🧾 Overview

The goal of this project is to perform a structured and visual analysis of the dataset. The notebook follows a well-organized approach to:

- Understand the structure and contents of the data  
- Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis  
- Generate summary statistics  
- Visualize distributions, correlations, and patterns  
- Derive key insights for further decision-making or modeling

---

## 🔍 Key Steps in the Analysis

- Data Loading & Initial Overview  
- Missing Values Treatment  
- Outlier Detection & Handling  
- Categorical & Numerical Feature Exploration  
- Correlation Matrix & Heatmap  
- Visual Storytelling using Seaborn & Matplotlib

---

## 📌 Features

✅ *Interactive Charts:* Distribution plots, histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps  
✅ *Clean Analysis Flow:* Easy-to-follow steps with comments and annotations  
✅ *Reproducible Code:* Pythonic and modular analysis ready for extension  
✅ *Insight Extraction:* Meaningful observations highlighted after each section
